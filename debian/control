Suggests: ceph
Description: FUSE-based client for the Ceph distributed file system
 Ceph is a distributed network file system designed to provide
 excellent performance, reliability, and scalability.  This is a
 FUSE-based client that allows one to mount a Ceph file system without

 Because the FUSE-based client has certain inherent performance
 limitations, it is recommended that the native Linux kernel client
 be used if possible.  If it is not practical to load a kernel module
 (insufficient privileges, older kernel, etc.), then the FUSE client will
 do.
